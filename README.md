Human trafficking is defined as "the trade of humans, most commonly for the purpose of sexual slavery, forced labor, or commercial sexual exploitation for the trafficker or others" [Wikipedia 1.16.2017]

Reported estimates of human trafficking range from 20-40 million people trapped in modern-day slavery. Given the nature of this black market, data collection can be difficult as well as the establishment of international standards for tracking trafficking flows, establishing and enforcing legislation, and leveraging technology to free those held captive. 

*libertas* is dedicated to compiling leading government research on human trafficking statistics, and identifying viable opportunities to leverage technology to secure freedom.
